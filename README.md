A Conversion Tool for the 4 Base Tiles of a Wang/DualMap TileSet and the filler tiles.
If your tile set has no underlay fill tile, ignore the underlay fill button. 

The Converter recreates the texture after every selected file, so you can check step by step if the result will be as expected.
The tile and tile set size size gets also determinated by the last uploaded file, but since they should always have the same size, it shouldn't matter.
